# COL772 NLP

Course Assignments for the course COL772 - Natural Language Processing, IIT Delhi for the spring semester 2024.

## Assignment 1: Language Identification

**Brief Description**: This assignment aims to introduce text categorization through the task of language identification. It is a crucial step for various NLP tasks like machine translation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. Build a supervised classification model that can identify the language of a given text in Roman script.

## Assignment 2.1: Table QA with Deep Learning

**Brief Description**: The second assignment is designed to give experience with developing and implementing neural models for tabular question answering (QA). Understanding and processing tabular data is essential in many domains such as finance, healthcare, and science. The challenge is to develop a classification model that, given a question and a corresponding database table, identifies the cells that correspond to the correct answer. The assignment focuses on the application of CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, or their extensions but prohibits the use of pretrained language models.

## Assignment 2.2: Table QA with Large Language Models

**Brief Description**: In this spin-off from Assignment 2.1, we're tasked with leveraging the Gemma model (gemma-7b-it-quant) for table question answering. The process involves crafting a textual prompt from a given table and question, which Gemma will respond to. The key is in post-processing Gemma's answer to pinpoint the exact row and column of the correct answer. This challenge tests the prowess of advanced language models against our previously developed supervised models, with a focus on the art of prompt engineering.
